REPLACE client->disconnect with Server::delete_client_by_nickname !*DONE*!
When closing IRSSI using /quit a CMD is issued to server (QUIT :leaving) that needs to be handled, similar to CAP. !*DONE*!

Some Error codes are not printed correctly in IRSSI (421 is an example).

Seg Fault upon joining the same channel with 2 different Users? Needs investigation.

Need to check IRSSI documentation for /unoper CMD. Says invalid CMD?

Broadcast not working as intended, needs to be redone.

I don't think PRIVMSG is working properly.

@Paula @Mariam Please check the comment on l48 in CommandOPER.cpp and check if it happens for your client as well.
